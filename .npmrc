# Security: Disable automatic execution of npm install scripts
# Prevents arbitrary code execution from malicious packages during installation
# This applies ONLY to npm (not yarn - yarn has its own security model)
ignore-scripts=true

# Why this is needed:
# - npm by default runs "preinstall", "install", and "postinstall" scripts
# - Malicious packages can use these scripts to execute arbitrary code
# - This protection is critical in CI/CD environments
#
# Native binary packages that require scripts:
# These packages are trusted because they:
# 1. Are widely used and audited by the community (millions of downloads)
# 2. Need to compile native bindings (C++/Rust/Go) for the target platform
# 3. Are locked to specific versions in yarn.lock preventing supply chain attacks
#
# Required packages with build scripts:
# - @swc/core: Rust-based JavaScript compiler, needs to build native bindings
# - esbuild: Go-based bundler, downloads pre-compiled platform-specific binary
# - sharp: Image processing library, compiles libvips C++ bindings
# - puppeteer: Headless Chrome automation, downloads Chromium binary
# - cypress: E2E testing framework, downloads Cypress binary and dependencies
# - @parcel/watcher: File system watcher, compiles native C++ bindings
# - msgpackr-extract: MessagePack serialization, compiles native decoder
#
# Security for yarn (used in this project):
# - yarn.lock provides cryptographic integrity checks (checksums)
# - `yarn install --immutable` enforces exact versions from lockfile
# - No dynamic package resolution during CI builds
# - This .npmrc does NOT affect yarn behavior
