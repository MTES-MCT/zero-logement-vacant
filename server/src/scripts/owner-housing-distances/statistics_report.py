"""
Script to generate statistics report for owner-housing distances and classifications.

This script analyzes the coverage and distribution of:
- Distance calculations (locprop_distance_ban)
- Relative classifications (locprop_relative_ban) with 7 possible values:
  1. Same postal code
  2. Same department
  3. Same region
  4. Owner in metro, different regions
  5. Owner in DOM-TOM, different regions
  6. Foreign country detected
  7. Other France cases or missing data

Provides detailed statistics on data completeness and classification patterns.
